Tic Tac Toe

Description:
The purpose of this Tic Tac Toe game is to familiarize myself with app development. The key is to get a basic understanding 
of what really goes into an app. Throughout the project I have learned much on the purpose of each screen and what is required 
to make a successful application. It requires some form of interactivity while aslo relaying whatever information the developer
wishes to send. I also learned about instances and how rotating a phone changes and alters the instance. This was key to getting
a succesful rotation working.

Installation:
In order to download and use the Tic Tac Toe game I have made one must already have Android Studio. The following steps are to download
the folder and open it as an existing project in Android Studio.
There is also an apk installation for any android device called app-debug.apk. Simply install this into your android device.

What works in this project:
I have 9 buttons that set text color, text, and assign a value to a "behind the scenes game board".
The game board checks to see if three buttons in a row, column, or diagonal are the same.
The game board stops the user from entering any other values after this condition has been met
There is a button to reset the buttons, their text, and the game board.
The instanced is saved, meaning that if the user were to rotate the screen they would not lose progress same applies for the
settings activity
There is a secondary activity

What is not completed:
The secondary activity is a settings activity template that has no current functionality
adding various settings and functionality would be ideal
